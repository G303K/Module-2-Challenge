        <p>
          Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Micah, I'm currently a housing community manager
          based in Michigan. I have a passion for computer technology and
          software. I possess a constant drive to better learn and develop new
          skillsets and work processes. I've been in the digital technology
          workforce for 5 years. My expertise lies in being able to adapt to any
          situation or problem I've been given. Areas that I excel in are
          property and time management, along with computer technology and CAD
          software. I have gone on to develop many 3D automated systems and
          designs, along with creating digital systems to help with home
          community management and development.
        </p>
        <p>
          When I'm not working, you can often find me being with friends and
          family or gaming. I'm a mechanic at heart, and I love working on
          vechicles, computers, or whatever I can get my hands on.
